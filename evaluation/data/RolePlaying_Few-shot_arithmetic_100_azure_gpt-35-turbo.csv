Multiples of 582: 582, 1164, 1746, 2328, 2910, 3492, ...

Multiples of 11: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, ...

From the lists, we can see that the smallest number that appears in both lists is 582.

Therefore, the common denominator of 115/582 and -4/11 is 582.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,262,184,6402.0,Arithmetic,lcm,3.1063668727874756

RolePlaying,True,arithmetic,Calculate the smallest common multiple of 286 and 364.,4004.0,"To find the smallest common multiple of 286 and 364, we can start by finding their prime factorizations:

286 = 2 * 11 * 13
364 = 2^2 * 7 * 13

Next, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number:

2^2 * 7 * 11 * 13

Multiplying these prime factors together, we get:

2 * 2 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 4004
