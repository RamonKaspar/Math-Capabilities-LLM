The ship originally contained x tons of grain.
And 49952 tons of grain spilled into the water.
So the remaining amount of grain onboard is x - 49952 tons.
But we also know that only 918 tons of grain remain onboard.
So we can set up the equation x - 49952 = 918.
To solve for x, we add 49952 to both sides of the equation: x = 918 + 49952.
Simplifying, we find that x = 50870.

ModelSelection,True,wordProblems,Randy has 90 blocks. He uses 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. How many more blocks did he use to build the house than he did to build the tower?,26.0,"Answer:
Randy started with 90 blocks.
He used 89 blocks to build a house.
And he used 63 blocks to build a tower.
To find out how many more blocks he used to build the house than the tower, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house.
So, 89 - 63 = 26.
Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.

Josh started with some marbles in his collection.
Then he lost 21 marbles.
So he had x - 21 marbles left, where x represents the number of marbles he had initially.
