ModelSelection,True,geometry,"a metallic sheet is of rectangular shape with dimensions 48 m x 36 m . from each of its corners , a square is cut off so as to make an open box . if the length of the square is 3 m , the volume of the box ( in m 3 ) is :",3.0,"Answer:
To find the volume of the box, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular sheet and subtract the volume of the four squares that are cut off.

The volume V of the rectangular sheet is calculated using the formula: V = length * width * height.
Here, the length is 48 m, the width is 36 m, and the height is 3 m (which is the length of the square cut off).
Substitute the values into the formula: V = 48 * 36 * 3 = 5184 m^3.

Now, let's calculate the volume of the four squares that are cut off.
The side length of each square is 3 m.
The volume of one square is calculated using the formula: V = side length * side length * height.
Here, the side length is 3 m and the height is also 3 m.
Substitute the values into the formula: V = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 m^3.
Since there are four squares, the total volume of the squares is 4 * 27 = 108 m^3.

Finally, we subtract the volume of the squares from the volume of the rectangular sheet to find the volume of the box:
Volume of the box = Volume of the rectangular sheet - Volume of the squares
Volume of the box = 5184 m^3 - 108 m^3 = 5076 m^3.

So, the volume of the box is 5076 m^3.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3092,470,3780.0,Geometry,geometry,9.783960580825806
ModelSelection,True,geometry,"a circle graph shows how the budget of a certain company was spent : 55 percent for salaries , 9 percent for research and development , 5 percent for utilities , 4 percent for equipment , 2 percent for supplies , and the remainder for transportation . if the area of each sector of the graph is proportional to the percent of the budget it represents , how many degrees of the circle are used to represent transportation ?",90.0,"Answer:
To find the number of degrees used to represent transportation, we need to calculate the percentage of the budget that is allocated to transportation and then convert it to degrees.

Given percentages:
Salaries: 55%
Research and Development: 9%
Utilities: 5%
Equipment: 4%
Supplies: 2%

To find the percentage allocated to transportation, we subtract the sum of the other percentages from 100%:
Transportation = 100% - (55% + 9% + 5% + 4% + 2%)
Transportation = 100% - 75%
Transportation = 25%

To convert the percentage to degrees, we use the fact that a circle has 360 degrees:
Degrees for transportation = (25% / 100%) * 360 degrees
Degrees for transportation = 0.25 * 360 degrees
Degrees for transportation = 90 degrees

So, 90 degrees of the circle are used to represent transportation.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1673,307,90.0,Geometry,geometry,7.489771127700806
ModelSelection,True,geometry,"if a rectangular billboard has an area of 91 square feet and a perimeter of 40 feet , what is the length of each of the shorter sides ?",7.0,"Answer:
Let's assume the length of the shorter side of the rectangular billboard is x feet. 

The area A of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:
A = length * width

Given that the area is 91 square feet, we have:
91 = x * width

The perimeter P of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides:
P = 2 * (length + width)

Given that the perimeter is 40 feet, we have:
40 = 2 * (x + width)

We can rearrange the second equation to solve for width:
20 = x + width

Now we have a system of two equations:
91 = x * width
20 = x + width

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of x (the length of the shorter side).

From the second equation, we can solve for width:
width = 20 - x

Substitute this value into the first equation:
91 = x * (20 - x)

Simplify the equation:
91 = 20x - x^2

Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:
x^2 - 20x + 91 = 0

Now we can solve this quadratic equation using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Let's use factoring:

(x - 7)(x - 13) = 0

This gives us two possible values for x: x = 7 or x = 13.

Since we are looking for the length of the shorter side, the answer is x = 7 feet.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3140,598,7.0,Geometry,geometry,13.945414781570435

ModelSelection,True,geometry,a lamp is put on one corner of a square plot of side 50 m . it ' s light reaches 21 m . find the area of that plot that is lit by that lamp ?,92.903,"Answer:
To find the area of the plot that is lit by the lamp, we need to find the area of the sector formed by the lamp's light.
The radius of the sector is the distance from the lamp to the edge of the lit area, which is 21 m.
The central angle of the sector can be found using the inverse tangent function: tan^(-1)(21/50).
Using a calculator, we find that the central angle is approximately 24.59 degrees.
The area of the sector can be calculated using the formula: A = (theta / 360) * pi * r^2, where theta is the central angle in degrees and r is the radius.
Substituting the values into the formula: A = (24.59 / 360) * pi * (21^2).
Evaluate 21^2 = 441.
Simplify the fraction 24.59/360 = 0.0683.
Complete the calculation: A = 0.0683 * pi * 441.
Now we compute it numerically using pi approximately 3.14159: A = 0.0683 * 3.14159 * 441.
A = 92.903 square meters.

Area of ABC = 1/2 * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|
Substituting the coordinates of A, B, and C:

To find the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles, we need to consider the pattern that emerges when creating the smaller triangles.

Let's start by finding the perimeter of the first equilateral triangle, t1. Since each side of t1 is 60 cm, the perimeter of t1 is 3 * 60 = 180 cm.

Now, let's consider the second equilateral triangle, t2. The sides of t2 are formed by joining the midpoints of t1. Since t1 has sides of length 60 cm, the sides of t2 will be half that length, which is 30 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of t2 is 3 * 30 = 90 cm.

Continuing this pattern, we can see that each subsequent equilateral triangle will have sides that are half the length of the previous triangle. So, the perimeter of t3 will be 3 * (30/2) = 45 cm, the perimeter of t4 will be 3 * (15/2) = 22.5 cm, and so on.

To find the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series. The formula is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

In this case, the first term a is 180 cm (perimeter of t1) and the common ratio r is 1/2 (since each subsequent triangle has sides that are half the length of the previous triangle).

Using the formula, we can calculate the sum of the perimeters:
S = 180 / (1 - 1/2) = 180 / (1/2) = 180 * 2 = 360 cm.

Therefore, the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles is 360 cm.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1659,701,360.0,Geometry,geometry,14.435353517532349

ModelSelection,True,geometry,a rectangle the length of which is 8 inches and the width of which is 6 inches is made up 48 1 inch by 1 inch squares . through how many of the squares does a diagonal of the rectangle pass ?,1.0,"Answer:
To find out how many of the 1 inch by 1 inch squares the diagonal of the rectangle passes through, we need to determine the length of the diagonal and then divide it by the length of one side of the square (which is 1 inch).

Step 1: Calculate the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem.
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
In this case, the length and width of the rectangle form the two sides of the right triangle, and the diagonal is the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
diagonal^2 = length^2 + width^2
diagonal^2 = 8^2 + 6^2
diagonal^2 = 64 + 36
diagonal^2 = 100
diagonal = √100
diagonal = 10 inches

Step 2: Divide the length of the diagonal by the length of one side of the square.
Number of squares = diagonal / side length
Number of squares = 10 inches / 1 inch
Number of squares = 10 squares

So, the diagonal of the rectangle passes through 10 of the 1 inch by 1 inch squares.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3061,482,12.0,Geometry,geometry,10.478538274765015
ModelSelection,True,geometry,"if the diameter of circle r is 60 % of the diameter of circle s , the area of circle r is what percent of the area of circle s ?",36.0,"Answer:
Let's assume the diameter of circle s is Ds. 
According to the given information, the diameter of circle r is 60% of the diameter of circle s, which means the diameter of circle r is 0.6 * Ds.
The radius of circle r is half of its diameter, so the radius of circle r is 0.6 * Ds / 2 = 0.3 * Ds.
The area of circle r is calculated using the formula A = π * r^2, where r is the radius.
So, the area of circle r is π * (0.3 * Ds)^2 = π * 0.09 * Ds^2.
The area of circle s is calculated using the same formula, but with the radius Ds / 2.
So, the area of circle s is π * (Ds / 2)^2 = π * 0.25 * Ds^2.
To find the percentage of the area of circle r compared to the area of circle s, we divide the area of circle r by the area of circle s and multiply by 100:
(π * 0.09 * Ds^2) / (π * 0.25 * Ds^2) * 100 = (0.09 / 0.25) * 100 = 0.36 * 100 = 36.
Therefore, the area of circle r is 36% of the area of circle s.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1569,466,36.0,Geometry,geometry,10.684526205062866

Let's assume the breadth of the plot is x meters.
According to the given information, the length is 25% less than the breadth, which means the length is 0.75x meters.
The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the breadth:
Area = Length * Breadth
Given that the area is 360 square meters, we can write the equation:
360 = 0.75x * x
Simplify the equation:
360 = 0.75x^2
Divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
480 = x^2
Take the square root of both sides to solve for x:
x = sqrt(480)

To find the difference in area between the two rectangular sheets of paper, we need to calculate the area of each sheet and then subtract the smaller area from the larger area.

For the first rectangular sheet measuring 11 inches by 13 inches:

To find the difference in area, we subtract the smaller area from the larger area:
Difference in area = 143 square inches - 71.5 square inches
Difference in area = 71.5 square inches

So, the combined area in square inches of the front and back of the larger rectangular sheet is 71.5 square inches greater than that of the smaller rectangular sheet.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1601,302,100.0,Geometry,geometry,7.614685535430908

ModelSelection,True,geometry,"the width of a rectangular hall is ½ of its length . if the area of the hall is 288 sq . m , what is the difference between its length and breadth ?",12.0,"Answer:
Let's assume the length of the rectangular hall is L meters.
According to the given information, the width of the hall is 1/2 of its length, which means the width is (1/2)L meters.
The area A of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width: A = L * (1/2)L = (1/2)L^2.
Given that the area of the hall is 288 sq. m, we can set up the equation: (1/2)L^2 = 288.
To solve for L, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2: L^2 = 576.
Taking the square root of both sides, we find: L = √576 = 24.
So, the length of the hall is 24 meters.
The width of the hall is (1/2)L = (1/2)*24 = 12 meters.
The difference between the length and width is 24 - 12 = 12 meters.
Therefore, the difference between the length and breadth of the hall is 12 meters.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1577,301,12.0,Geometry,geometry,7.5178728103637695
ModelSelection,True,geometry,the slant height of a right circular cone is 10 m and its height is 8 m . find the area of its curved surface .,188.49556,"Answer:
To find the area of the curved surface of a right circular cone, we need to use the formula:
A = π * r * l, where A is the area, r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height.

Given that the slant height l is 10 m and the height h is 8 m, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius r:
r = √(l^2 - h^2)
r = √(10^2 - 8^2)
r = √(100 - 64)
r = √36
r = 6 m

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:
A = π * 6 * 10
A = 60π

Now we can compute it numerically using π approximately 3.14159:
A ≈ 60 * 3.14159
A ≈ 188.49556

To find the rise in water level, we need to calculate the volume of the cube and the volume of the rectangular vessel.

The volume V of a cube is calculated using the formula: V = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube.
Given that the edge of the cube is 12 cm, we can calculate its volume:
V_cube = 12^3 = 1728 cm^3

The volume V of a rectangular vessel is calculated using the formula: V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
Given that the dimensions of the base of the vessel are 20 cm * 15 cm, and the height is the rise in water level, we can calculate its volume:
V_vessel = 20 * 15 * h

Since the cube is completely immersed in the vessel, the volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the water displaced by the cube. Therefore, we can equate the volumes:
V_cube = V_vessel
1728 = 20 * 15 * h

Now we can solve for h, the rise in water level:
h = 1728 / (20 * 15)
h = 1728 / 300
h = 5.76 cm

So the rise in water level is 5.76 cm.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3096,525,5.76,Geometry,geometry,10.950910568237305

ModelSelection,True,geometry,the diagonal of the floor of a rectangular closet is 7 feet . the shorter side of the closet is 4 feet . what is the area of the closet in square feet ?,33.0,"Answer:
To find the area of the closet, we need to know the length of the longer side. Let's call it ""x"".

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the longer side. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, the diagonal of the floor is the hypotenuse, and the shorter side and the longer side are the other two sides.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
(4^2) + (x^2) = (7^2)

Simplifying the equation:
16 + x^2 = 49

Subtracting 16 from both sides:
x^2 = 33

Taking the square root of both sides:
x = √33

Now that we know the length of the longer side, we can calculate the area of the closet by multiplying the length and width:
Area = 4 * √33

ModelSelection,True,geometry,"if each side of a right triangle is increased by 10 % and the base ( b ) is half of the height , find the percentage change in its area ?",21.0,"Answer:
Let's assume the original base of the right triangle is b and the original height is h.

Given that the base (b) is half of the height (h), we can write the equation: b = (1/2)h.

The original area of the right triangle is given by the formula: A = (1/2) * b * h.

Now, let's calculate the new dimensions of the right triangle after increasing each side by 10%.

The new base (b') is calculated by adding 10% to the original base: b' = b + 0.1b = 1.1b.

The new height (h') is calculated by adding 10% to the original height: h' = h + 0.1h = 1.1h.

The new area of the right triangle is given by the formula: A' = (1/2) * b' * h'.

Substituting the new dimensions into the formula, we get: A' = (1/2) * (1.1b) * (1.1h) = 1.21 * (1/2) * b * h = 1.21 * A.

Therefore, the new area is 1.21 times the original area.

To find the percentage change in the area, we calculate the difference between the new area and the original area, divide it by the original area, and multiply by 100.

Percentage change in area = ((A' - A) / A) * 100 = ((1.21A - A) / A) * 100 = (0.21A / A) * 100 = 21%.

To find the amount of fencing required, we need to calculate the perimeter of the field.
Given that one side of the field is already uncovered, we need to find the perimeter of the remaining three sides.
Let's assume the length of the field is L and the width is W.
We know that the area of the field is 60 sq. feet, so we have the equation:
L * W = 60
We also know that one side of the field is 20 feet, so we have the equation:
L + 2W = perimeter - 20
To find the perimeter, we need to solve for L and W.
From the first equation, we can express L in terms of W:
L = 60 / W
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
60 / W + 2W = perimeter - 20
To simplify the equation, let's multiply through by W:
60 + 2W^2 = W * perimeter - 20W
Rearranging the equation, we have:
2W^2 - W * perimeter + 20W - 60 = 0
Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the values of W.
Once we have the values of W, we can substitute them back into the equation L = 60 / W to find the corresponding values of L.
Finally, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of the three sides (L + 2W + L) and add 20 feet to account for the uncovered side.

To find the volume of the box, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular sheet and subtract the volume of the four squares that were cut off.

The volume V of the rectangular sheet is calculated using the formula: V = length * width * height.
Here, the length is 48 m, the width is 38 m, and the height is 8 m (which is the length of the square cut off from each corner).

Calculate the volume of the rectangular sheet: V_rectangular = 48 * 38 * 8.

The volume of each square cut off is calculated using the formula: V_square = side^3.
Here, the side of the square is 8 m.

Calculate the volume of each square: V_square = 8^3.

Since four squares were cut off, we need to multiply the volume of one square by 4.

Calculate the total volume of the squares: V_squares = 4 * V_square.

Finally, subtract the volume of the squares from the volume of the rectangular sheet to find the volume of the box: V_box = V_rectangular - V_squares.

V_rectangular = 48 * 38 * 8 = 14656 m^3.

V_square = 8^3 = 512 m^3.

V_squares = 4 * V_square = 4 * 512 = 2048 m^3.

Let's denote the length of the smaller piece as x mm. Since the larger piece is 50 mm greater, its length would be x + 50 mm.

The sum of the lengths of the two pieces should be equal to the length of the original slab, which is 600 mm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) = 600

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 50 = 600

The original cube has dimensions of 3' x 3' x 3', which means each side of the cube is 3 feet long.
The surface area of each face of the cube is 3' x 3' = 9 square feet.
Since there are 6 faces on the cube, the total surface area of the cube is 6 x 9 = 54 square feet.
When the cube is cut into 27 smaller cubes, each smaller cube has dimensions of 1' x 1' x 1'.
The surface area of each face of the smaller cube is 1' x 1' = 1 square foot.
Since there are 6 faces on each smaller cube, the total surface area of each smaller cube is 6 x 1 = 6 square feet.
Out of the 27 smaller cubes, only the outer layer of cubes will have painted surfaces.

To find out how many more square inches of pizza they can buy if they pool their money, we need to calculate the total area of pizza they can buy individually and then compare it to the total area they can buy together.

For the small pizza:
The area A of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself:
A = side * side
For the small pizza, the side length is 14 inches.
A = 14 * 14
A = 196 square inches

For the large pizza:
For the large pizza, the side length is 21 inches.
A = 21 * 21
A = 441 square inches

Now, let's calculate the total area they can buy individually:
For each friend, with $30, they can buy:
$30 / $10 = 3 small pizzas
Total area for each friend = 3 * 196 = 588 square inches

Now, let's calculate the total area they can buy together:
With $30 apiece, they have a total of $30 + $30 = $60.
With $60, they can buy:
$60 / $10 = 6 small pizzas
Total area together = 6 * 196 = 1176 square inches

To find the difference in square inches, we subtract the total area they can buy individually from the total area they can buy together:
1176 - 588 = 588 square inches

Therefore, if they pool their money, they can buy 588 more square inches of pizza than if they each purchase pizza alone.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3308,594,49.0,Geometry,geometry,12.42322063446045

Let's assume that the cost per liter of the solution is C cents and the fraction of spirit in the solution is F.

According to the given information, when the solution contains 1 liter of spirit and 1 liter of water, the cost is 30 cents. This means that when F = 1/2 (since 1 liter of spirit is half of the total volume), C = 30.

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the cost when the solution contains 1 liter of spirit and 2 liters of water.

Since the fraction of spirit in this case is F = 1/3 (since 1 liter of spirit is one-third of the total volume), we can set up the proportion:

(F1 / C1) = (F2 / C2)

Substituting the values we know:

(1/2) / 30 = (1/3) / C2

Simplifying the equation:

C2 = (30 * 1/3) / (1/2)
C2 = (30/3) * (2/1)
C2 = 20 * 2
C2 = 40

To find the area of the path, we need to subtract the area of the inner rectangle (grass field) from the area of the outer rectangle (including the path).

1. Calculate the area of the grass field:
Area of the grass field = length * width = 75 m * 55 m = 4125 sq m.

2. Calculate the dimensions of the outer rectangle (including the path):
Length of the outer rectangle = length of the grass field + 2 * width of the path = 75 m + 2 * 2.8 m = 75 m + 5.6 m = 80.6 m.
Width of the outer rectangle = width of the grass field + 2 * width of the path = 55 m + 2 * 2.8 m = 55 m + 5.6 m = 60.6 m.

3. Calculate the area of the outer rectangle:
Area of the outer rectangle = length * width = 80.6 m * 60.6 m = 4893.96 sq m.

4. Calculate the area of the path:
Area of the path = Area of the outer rectangle - Area of the grass field = 4893.96 sq m - 4125 sq m = 768.96 sq m.

5. Calculate the cost of constructing the path:
Cost of constructing the path = Area of the path * Cost per sq m = 768.96 sq m * Rs. 2/sq m = Rs. 1537.92.

ModelSelection,True,geometry,the length of a rectangle is increased by 45 % and its breadth is decreased by 20 % . what is the effect on its area ?,16.0,"Answer:
To determine the effect on the area of the rectangle, we need to calculate the new area after the changes in length and breadth.

Let's assume the original length of the rectangle is L and the original breadth is B.

The length is increased by 45%, which means the new length is L + (45/100) * L = L + 0.45L = 1.45L.

The breadth is decreased by 20%, which means the new breadth is B - (20/100) * B = B - 0.2B = 0.8B.

The original area of the rectangle is A = L * B.

The new area of the rectangle is A' = (1.45L) * (0.8B) = 1.16LB.

To determine the effect on the area, we can compare the new area to the original area:

Effect on the area = (A' - A) / A * 100%.

Substituting the values, we get:

Effect on the area = (1.16LB - LB) / LB * 100%.

Simplifying, we have:

Effect on the area = 0.16LB / LB * 100%.

The LB terms cancel out, and we are left with:

Effect on the area = 0.16 * 100% = 16%.

To calculate the number of handshakes, we need to consider the handshakes between the business executives and the handshakes between the chairmen.

Handshakes between the business executives:
There are 12 business executives, and each executive shakes hands with every other executive once. We can use the formula for the number of handshakes between n people: (n * (n-1)) / 2.
Substituting n = 12 into the formula: (12 * (12-1)) / 2 = (12 * 11) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66 handshakes.

Handshakes between the chairmen and the business executives:
There are 12 business executives and 7 chairmen. Each chairman shakes hands with each of the 12 business executives once.
So, the number of handshakes between the chairmen and the business executives is 7 * 12 = 84 handshakes.

Total number of handshakes:
To find the total number of handshakes, we add the number of handshakes between the business executives and the number of handshakes between the chairmen and the business executives:

Let's denote the length of the legs as ""a"" and the length of the hypotenuse as ""c"". Since it is an isosceles right triangle, the length of the legs will be equal.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have the equation:

Step 1: Write down the given information.
The area of the rectangle is 300 square meters: A = 300.
The perimeter of the rectangle is 70 meters: P = 70.

Step 2: Write down the formulas for area and perimeter.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = L * W.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W.

Step 3: Substitute the given information into the formulas.
For the area: 300 = L * W.
For the perimeter: 70 = 2L + 2W.

Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the area equation, we can solve for L: L = 300 / W.

Substitute this value of L into the perimeter equation: 70 = 2(300 / W) + 2W.

Simplify the equation: 70 = 600 / W + 2W.

Multiply both sides of the equation by W to eliminate the fraction: 70W = 600 + 2W^2.

Rearrange the equation: 2W^2 - 70W + 600 = 0.

Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation.
We can solve the quadratic equation by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's use factoring.

Factor the quadratic equation: (2W - 20)(W - 30) = 0.

Set each factor equal to zero and solve for W:
2W - 20 = 0 or W - 30 = 0.

Solve for W:

Let's assume the original length of the rectangle is L and the original width is W. The original area is A = L * W.

If the length is reduced by 22%, the new length becomes L' = L - 0.22L = 0.78L.

To maintain the original area, the new width needs to be increased by a certain percentage. Let's call this percentage X.

The new width becomes W' = W + X/100 * W = W + 0.01XW = (1 + 0.01X)W.

The new area is A' = L' * W' = (0.78L) * (1 + 0.01X)W.

Since we want the new area to be equal to the original area, we have:

A' = A
(0.78L) * (1 + 0.01X)W = L * W

Dividing both sides by LW:

0.78 * (1 + 0.01X) = 1

Simplifying the equation:

0.78 + 0.0078X = 1
0.0078X = 0.22
X = 0.22 / 0.0078
X ≈ 28.21

Let's assume that the number of cabbages produced last year was x.
Since each cabbage takes up 1 square foot of area, the total area used for growing cabbages last year would be x square feet.
This year, the lady has increased her output by 211 cabbages compared to last year. So the total number of cabbages produced this year would be x + 211.
The shape of the area used for growing cabbages has remained a square in both years, which means the area used this year is also x square feet.
Since each cabbage takes up 1 square foot of area, the total number of cabbages produced this year would be equal to the area used for growing cabbages this year, which is x.
Therefore, x + 211 = x.

ModelSelection,True,geometry,"a rectangular field is to be fenced on three sides leaving a side of 20 feet uncovered . if the area of the field is 440 sq . feet , how many feet of fencing will be required ?",33.33,"Answer:
To find the amount of fencing required, we need to calculate the perimeter of the field.
Let's assume the length of the field is L and the width is W.
Given that one side of the field is already uncovered and has a length of 20 feet, we can assume that the length of the field is L + 20 feet.
The area of the field is given as 440 square feet, so we have the equation:
L * W = 440
We also know that the perimeter P of a rectangle is given by:
P = 2L + 2W
Substituting L + 20 for L in the equation, we get:
P = 2(L + 20) + 2W
Simplifying, we have:
P = 2L + 40 + 2W
Since we want to fence three sides of the field, we need to calculate the perimeter of three sides, which is:
3P = 3(2L + 40 + 2W)
Simplifying further, we get:
3P = 6L + 120 + 6W
Now, we can substitute the value of L * W from the given area equation:
3P = 6L + 120 + 6W = 440
Rearranging the equation, we have:
6L + 6W = 440 - 120
6L + 6W = 320
Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
L + W = 320 / 6
L + W = 53.33
Since we know that one side is already uncovered and has a length of 20 feet, we can subtract this from the sum of L and W:
L + W - 20 = 53.33 - 20
L + W - 20 = 33.33
Therefore, the amount of fencing required is 33.33 feet",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3079,510,64.0,Geometry,geometry,11.704187870025635
ModelSelection,True,geometry,the radius of a sphere is increased by 50 % . the increase in surface area of the sphere is :,2.0,"Answer:
To find the increase in surface area of a sphere when the radius is increased by 50%, we need to compare the surface area before and after the increase.

The formula for the surface area of a sphere is: A = 4πr^2, where A is the surface area and r is the radius.

Let's assume the original radius is r. After increasing the radius by 50%, the new radius becomes 1.5r.

The original surface area is A1 = 4πr^2.
The new surface area is A2 = 4π(1.5r)^2 = 4π(2.25r^2) = 9πr^2.

To find the increase in surface area, we subtract the original surface area from the new surface area:
Increase in surface area = A2 - A1 = 9πr^2 - 4πr^2 = 5πr^2.

So, the increase in surface area of the sphere is 5πr^2.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,2865,358,125.0,Geometry,geometry,7.609563827514648
ModelSelection,True,geometry,"a cube of edge 15 cm is imersed completely in a rectangular vessel containing water . if the dimensions of the base of vessel are 20 cm * 15 cm , find the rise in waer level .",11.25,"Answer:
To find the rise in water level, we need to calculate the volume of the cube and the volume of the rectangular vessel.

The volume V of a cube is calculated using the formula: V = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube.
Given that the edge of the cube is 15 cm, we can calculate its volume:
V_cube = 15^3 = 3375 cm^3

The volume V of a rectangular vessel is calculated using the formula: V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
Given that the dimensions of the base of the vessel are 20 cm * 15 cm, and the height is the rise in water level, we can calculate its volume:
V_vessel = 20 * 15 * h = 300h cm^3

Since the cube is completely immersed in the vessel, the volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the water displaced, which is equal to the rise in water level.
Therefore, we can set up the equation:
V_cube = V_vessel
3375 = 300h
Solve for h:
h = 3375 / 300 = 11.25 cm

So, the rise in water level is 11.25 cm.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3106,529,11.25,Geometry,geometry,11.616336822509766
ModelSelection,True,geometry,"in measuring the sides of a rectangle , one side is taken 9 % in excess , and the other 8 % in deficit . find the error percent in the area calculated from these measurements .",0.08,"Answer:
Let's assume the original length of the rectangle is L and the original width is W.

According to the problem, one side is taken 9% in excess, so the length becomes L + 0.09L = 1.09L.
Similarly, the other side is taken 8% in deficit, so the width becomes W - 0.08W = 0.92W.

The original area of the rectangle is A = L * W.
The new area of the rectangle is A' = (1.09L) * (0.92W) = 1.0008LW.

The error in the area is the difference between the new area and the original area: Error = A' - A = 1.0008LW - LW = 0.0008LW.

To find the error percent, we divide the error by the original area and multiply by 100:
Error percent = (Error / A) * 100 = (0.0008LW / LW) * 100 = 0.08%.

Given:
-4 ≤ x ≤ 5
6 ≤ y ≤ 16

Since point P is the right angle of the triangle and PR is parallel to the x-axis, we can fix the x-coordinate of point P to be any integer between -4 and 5.

For each x-coordinate of P, we can choose the y-coordinate of P to be any integer between 6 and 16.

Therefore, the number of possible coordinates for point P is (5 - (-4) + 1) * (16 - 6 + 1) = 10 * 11 = 110.

For each choice of P, we can choose the x-coordinate of point Q to be any integer between -4 and 5, excluding the x-coordinate of P.

To find the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles, we need to consider the pattern that emerges when creating the smaller triangles.

Let's start by finding the perimeter of the first equilateral triangle, t1. Since each side of t1 is 50 cm, the perimeter of t1 is 3 * 50 = 150 cm.

Now, let's consider the second equilateral triangle, t2. The sides of t2 are formed by joining the midpoints of t1. Since t1 has sides of length 50 cm, the sides of t2 will be half that length, which is 25 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of t2 is 3 * 25 = 75 cm.

For each subsequent equilateral triangle, tn, the sides will be half the length of the previous triangle, tn-1. So, the perimeter of tn will be 3 * (1/2)^n * 50 cm.

To find the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles, we need to sum up the perimeters of each triangle from t1 to infinity. This can be represented as an infinite geometric series.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula: S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

In this case, the first term a is 150 cm (perimeter of t1) and the common ratio r is 1/2 (since each subsequent triangle has sides half the length of the previous triangle).

Using the formula, the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles is:
S = 150 / (1 - 1/2)
S = 150 / (1/2)
S = 150 * 2
S = 300 cm

Therefore, the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles is 300 cm.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1659,629,300.0,Geometry,geometry,14.891416072845459

To calculate the area of a triangle, we can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is given by:

A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as:

s = (a + b + c) / 2

In this case, the sides of the triangle are given as 39 cm, 32 cm, and 10 cm. Let's calculate the area step by step:

1. Calculate the semi-perimeter:
s = (39 + 32 + 10) / 2
s = 81 / 2

To calculate the percentage of area outside the square in the equilateral triangle, we need to find the areas of both the triangle and the square.

1. Area of the equilateral triangle:
The formula for the area A of an equilateral triangle is: A = (sqrt(3) / 4) * s^2, where s is the length of one side of the triangle.
Given that the side length of the equilateral triangle is 5 m, we can substitute the value into the formula:
A = (sqrt(3) / 4) * (5^2)
A = (sqrt(3) / 4) * 25
A = (1.732 / 4) * 25
A = 4.33 * 25
A = 108.25 square meters

2. Area of the square:
The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side. Given that the side length of the square is 2 m, we can calculate the area:
A = 2^2
A = 4 square meters

3. Area outside the square:
To find the area outside the square in the triangle, we subtract the area of the square from the area of the triangle:
Area outside square = Area of triangle - Area of square
Area outside square = 108.25 - 4
Area outside square = 104.25 square meters

4. Percentage of area outside square:
To calculate the percentage, we divide the area outside the square by the area of the triangle and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Area outside square / Area of triangle) * 100
Percentage = (104.25 / 108.25) * 100
Percentage = 0.963 * 100
Percentage = 96.3%

Given:
- Each tree takes up one square foot of sidewalk space.
- There are 20 feet between each tree.

ModelSelection,True,geometry,"the ratio of the areas of two squares , one having double its diagonal then the other is :",1.0,"Answer:
Let's assume the side length of the smaller square is ""s"" and the side length of the larger square is ""2s"" (since the larger square has double the diagonal of the smaller square).

The area of a square is calculated by squaring its side length. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is s^2 and the area of the larger square is (2s)^2 = 4s^2.

To find the ratio of the areas, we divide the area of the larger square by the area of the smaller square:
Ratio = (Area of larger square) / (Area of smaller square)
Ratio = (4s^2) / (s^2)
Ratio = 4

Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the two squares is 4:1.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,2822,323,4.0,Geometry,geometry,9.970255851745605
ModelSelection,True,geometry,if abc is a quarter circle and a smaller circle is inscribed in it ; if radius of quarter circle is 1.414 units . find the radius of smaller circle,0.9999,"Answer:
Let's denote the radius of the smaller circle as r.

In a quarter circle, the radius is equal to the side length of the square inscribed in it. Since the radius of the quarter circle is given as 1.414 units, the side length of the square is also 1.414 units.

The diagonal of a square is equal to twice the radius of the inscribed circle. Therefore, the diagonal of the square is 2r.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the diagonal of the square:
(diagonal)^2 = (side length)^2 + (side length)^2
(2r)^2 = (1.414)^2 + (1.414)^2
4r^2 = 1.9996 + 1.9996
4r^2 = 3.9992
r^2 = 3.9992 / 4
r^2 = 0.9998
r = sqrt(0.9998)

Now we can calculate the value of r:
r = sqrt(0.9998) ≈ 0.9999

So, the radius of the smaller circle is approximately 0.9999 units.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1573,393,0.5860000000000001,Geometry,geometry,9.25599479675293

ModelSelection,True,geometry,"in measuring the sides of a rectangle , one side is taken 5 % in excess , and the other 4 % in deficit . find the error percent in the error percent in the area calculated from these measurements .",0.8,"Answer:
Let's assume the original length of the rectangle is L and the original width is W.

According to the problem, one side is taken 5% in excess, so the length becomes L + 0.05L = 1.05L.
Similarly, the other side is taken 4% in deficit, so the width becomes W - 0.04W = 0.96W.

The original area of the rectangle is A = L * W.
The new area of the rectangle is A' = (1.05L) * (0.96W) = 1.008LW.

To find the error percent in the area, we need to calculate the difference between the new area and the original area, divide it by the original area, and multiply by 100.

Error percent = ((A' - A) / A) * 100
             = ((1.008LW - LW) / LW) * 100
             = (0.008LW / LW) * 100
             = 0.8%

ModelSelection,True,geometry,"the length of rectangle is thrice its breadth and its perimeter is 120 m , find the area of the rectangle ?",675.0,"Answer:
Let's assume the breadth of the rectangle is x meters.
According to the given information, the length of the rectangle is thrice its breadth, so the length would be 3x meters.

The formula for the perimeter P of a rectangle is: P = 2(length + breadth).
Substituting the given values, we have:
120 = 2(3x + x)

Simplifying the equation:
120 = 2(4x)
120 = 8x
Dividing both sides by 8:
x = 15

So, the breadth of the rectangle is 15 meters, and the length is 3x = 3 * 15 = 45 meters.

The formula for the area A of a rectangle is: A = length * breadth.
Substituting the values, we have:
A = 45 * 15
A = 675

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 675 square meters.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1553,265,675.0,Geometry,geometry,6.182142496109009
ModelSelection,True,geometry,the length and breadth of a square are increased by 40 % and 30 % respectively . the area of the rectangle so formed exceeds the area of the square by ?,0.82,"Answer:
Let's assume the original length and breadth of the square are L and B, respectively.
The area of the square is given by A_square = L * B.

According to the problem, the length is increased by 40%, so the new length is L + 0.4L = 1.4L.
Similarly, the breadth is increased by 30%, so the new breadth is B + 0.3B = 1.3B.

The area of the rectangle formed is A_rectangle = (1.4L) * (1.3B) = 1.82LB.

The difference in area between the rectangle and the square is A_rectangle - A_square = 1.82LB - LB = 0.82LB.

Therefore, the area of the rectangle exceeds the area of the square by 0.82 times the area of the square.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1573,348,81.99999999999999,Geometry,geometry,6.503164291381836

ModelSelection,True,geometry,a horse is tethered to one corner of a rectangular grassy field 45 m by 25 m with a rope 22 m long . over how much area of the field can it graze ?,1520.53096,"Answer:
To find the area of the field that the horse can graze, we need to find the area of the circular region centered at the corner where the horse is tethered.

The radius of the circular region is equal to the length of the rope, which is 22 m.

The area A of a circle is calculated using the formula: A = pi * r^2, where r is the radius.

Substitute the value of the radius into the formula:
A = pi * (22^2)

Evaluate 22^2 = 484

Now we compute it numerically using pi approximately 3.14159:
A = 3.14159 * 484

A = 1520.53096

ModelSelection,True,geometry,"four equal circles are described about the four corners of a square so that each touches two of the others . if a side of the square is 14 cm , then the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is :",2.0,"Answer:
To find the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles, we need to find the area of the square and subtract the area of the four circles.

Step 1: Find the area of the square
The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself.
Given that the side of the square is 14 cm, the area of the square is:
Area of square = side * side = 14 cm * 14 cm = 196 cm^2

Step 2: Find the area of one circle
The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: A = π * r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.
Since the circles touch two others, the radius of each circle is half the length of the side of the square.
Radius of circle = 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm
Area of one circle = π * (7 cm)^2 = 49π cm^2

Step 3: Find the area of the four circles
Since there are four circles, the total area of the four circles is:
Total area of four circles = 4 * (Area of one circle) = 4 * (49π cm^2) = 196π cm^2

Step 4: Find the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles
The area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is the difference between the area of the square and the total area of the four circles:
Area enclosed = Area of square - Total area of four circles
Area enclosed = 196 cm^2 - 196π cm^2

So, the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is 196 cm^2 - 196π cm^2.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,3129,550,42.06195997410015,Geometry,geometry,11.373106479644775
