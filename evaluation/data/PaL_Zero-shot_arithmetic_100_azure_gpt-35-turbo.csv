PaL,False,arithmetic,What is the common denominator of -93/58 and -5/58?,,"To find the common denominator of two fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators. In this case, the denominators are both 58.

To find the LCM of two numbers, we can use the formula:

LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)

where GCD(a, b) represents the greatest common divisor of a and b.

In Python, we can use the math module to find the GCD using the gcd() function. Here's the code to find the common denominator:

```python
import math

denominator1 = 58
denominator2 = 58

common_denominator = (denominator1 * denominator2) // math.gcd(denominator1, denominator2)

print(""The common denominator is:"", common_denominator)
