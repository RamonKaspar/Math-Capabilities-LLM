Therefore, 80319.95 kilograms is equal to 80,319,950,000 micrograms.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,59,125,80319950000000.0,Arithmetic,conversion,4.724822759628296
CoT,False,arithmetic,Calculate the smallest common multiple of 7272 and 909.,7272.0,"To find the smallest common multiple of two numbers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of those numbers. 

To find the LCM of 7272 and 909, we can start by finding the prime factorization of each number.

Prime factorization of 7272:
7272 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 101

Prime factorization of 909:
909 = 3 * 3 * 101

Now, we can find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number.

LCM = 2^3 * 3^2 * 101 = 8 * 9 * 101 = 7272

Therefore, the smallest common multiple of 7272 and 909 is 7272.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,61,165,7272.0,Arithmetic,lcm,5.4845874309539795
