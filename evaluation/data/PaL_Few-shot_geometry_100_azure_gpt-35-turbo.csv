PaL,True,geometry,"a crate measures 7 feet by 8 feet by 12 feet on the inside . a stone pillar in the shape of a right circular cylinder must fit into the crate for shipping so that it rests upright when the crate sits on at least one of its six sides . what is the radius , in feet , of the pillar with the largest volume that could still fit in the crate ?",,"To find the radius of the pillar with the largest volume that can fit in the crate, we need to consider the dimensions of the crate and the condition that the pillar must rest upright when the crate sits on at least one of its six sides.

Let's assume the radius of the pillar is r feet. The height of the pillar can be determined by the dimensions of the crate. Since the crate measures 7 feet by 8 feet by 12 feet on the inside, the height of the pillar should be less than or equal to 7 feet, 8 feet, or 12 feet.

To find the largest volume, we can iterate through different values of the radius and calculate the volume of the pillar. We will keep track of the maximum volume and the corresponding radius.
