Let V_total be the total volume of the hemispheres [[var V_total]]. We have [[eq V_total = n * V_h]].
We know that the volume of a sphere is given by V_sphere = (4/3) * pi * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
Since each hemisphere is half of a sphere, the volume of each hemisphere is given by V_hemisphere = (1/2) * V_sphere.
We can rewrite this equation as V_h = (1/2) * ((4/3) * pi * r^3).

To find the value of P_total, we need to find the value of n. Since each triangle has half the side length of the previous triangle, the side length of tn will be s/2^n.
We want to find the value of n such that s/2^n is less than a very small value, say 0.001 cm, to ensure that the sum converges to a finite value.

Let d be the length of the diagonal of the parallelogram [[var d]].
Let b be the length of the base of the triangle formed by the diagonal of the parallelogram [[var b]].
Let h be the height of the triangle formed by the diagonal of the parallelogram [[var h]].
We know that the area of a parallelogram is given by A_p = b * h.
Since the diagonal of the parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles, the area of each triangle is (1/2) * b * h.
Therefore, the area of the triangle formed by the diagonal is A_t = (1/2) * b * h.
To find the area of the triangle, we need to find the length of the base and the height.
Since the diagonal of the parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles, the base of the triangle is equal to the length of the diagonal, b = d.
To find the height, we can use the formula for the area of a parallelogram: A_p = b * h.
Substituting the values, we have 128 = d * h.
Therefore, h = 128 / d.
Now we can substitute the values of b and h into the formula for the area of the triangle: A_t = (1/2) * b * h.
Substituting b = d and h = 128 / d, we have A_t = (1/2) * d * (128 / d).
Simplifying, we get A_t = 64.
The answer is the value of A_t, which is 64 [[answer A_t]].",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,936,394,64.0,Geometry,geometry,7.4050681591033936

The other piece is 50 mm greater than x, so its length is x + 50 mm.
The original uncut slab is 600 mm, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces after cutting is 600 mm.
Therefore, we have the equation x + (x + 50) = 600.
Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 50 = 600.
Subtracting 50 from both sides, we have 2x = 550.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 275.
The length of the other piece of the potato after it is cut is x + 50 = 275 + 50 = 325 mm.

The total surface area of the cubic object is also equal to the sum of the surface areas of the 1-inch cubes.
Each 1-inch cube has a surface area of 6 square inches, since all sides are painted.
Therefore, the total surface area of the cubic object is also equal to 6n.
We can set up the equation 6s^2 = 6n.

Let W be the original width of the rectangle [[var W]].
Let A be the original area of the rectangle [[var A]]. We have [[eq A = L * W]].

The length is reduced by 22%, so the new length is (100% - 22%) of the original length, which is 78% of the original length. Therefore, the new length is 0.78L.

Let x be the percentage increase in width needed to maintain the original area [[var x]].
The new width is (100% + x%) of the original width, which is (100 + x)% of the original width. Therefore, the new width is (100 + x)%W.

The new area is the product of the new length and new width, which is (0.78L) * ((100 + x)%W).

To maintain the original area, the new area should be equal to the original area. Therefore, we have the equation:
(0.78L) * ((100 + x)%W) = A

To solve for x, we can substitute A = L * W into the equation:
(0.78L) * ((100 + x)%W) = L * W

Simplifying the equation, we have:
0.78 * (100 + x)% = 100

To solve for x, we can isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.78:

Let b be the breadth of the rectangle [[var b]].
We're given that the length of the rectangle is thrice its breadth, so we have the equation [[eq l = 3*b]].
We're also given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 120 m, so we have the equation [[eq 2*l + 2*b = 120]].
To find the area of the rectangle, we use the formula A = l * b.
Substituting the value of l from the first equation, we have A = (3*b) * b = 3*b^2.
The answer is the value of A [[answer A]].

DeclarativeSymPy,True,geometry,the length and breadth of a square are increased by 40 % and 30 % respectively . the area of the rectangle so formed exceeds the area of the square by ?,,"Let s be the length of the side of the square [[var s]].
The length of the rectangle is increased by 40%, so the new length is (s + 0.4s) = 1.4s.
The breadth of the rectangle is increased by 30%, so the new breadth is (s + 0.3s) = 1.3s.
The area of the square is s^2.
The area of the rectangle is (1.4s)(1.3s) = 1.82s^2.
The difference in area between the rectangle and the square is 1.82s^2 - s^2 = 0.82s^2.
The answer is 0.82s^2.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,935,158,81.99999999999999,Geometry,geometry,2.859191656112671

Let x be the square root of n [[var x]].
Let y be the upside-down version of n [[var y]].

From the given information, we know that n is a perfect square and y is also a perfect square.

We are told that the bus company had only 5 100 buses numbered from 1 to 500. Therefore, n must be between 1 and 500.

To find the possible values of n, we can iterate through the numbers from 1 to 500 and check if both n and y are perfect squares.

For each number i from 1 to 500:
  - Let x be the square root of i.
  - Let y be the upside-down version of i.
  - If both x and y are perfect squares, add i to the list of possible values of n.

The answer is the list of possible values of n [[answer possible_values]].

Note: To check if a number is a perfect square, we can use the isqrt() function from the math module in Python.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,1044,223,196.0,Geometry,geometry,4.491299867630005

Let r be the radius of each circle [[var r]].

Since each circle touches two others, the diameter of each circle is equal to the side length of the square. Therefore, the radius of each circle is half the side length of the square. We have [[eq r = s/2]].

The area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles can be found by subtracting the area of the square from the sum of the areas of the four circles. We have [[eq A = 4 * pi * r^2 - s^2]].
