Now, the diameter of the semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 17 cm. We can calculate the circumference of the semicircle using the formula:

Given that the radius is 7 cm and each piece touches two other pieces, the central angle of each sector is 90 degrees.

The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal = s√2.

So, in this case, the diagonal of the smaller square is d = s√2.

The ratio of their side lengths is 2d/s = 2(s√2)/s = 2√2.

Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the two squares is (2√2)^2 = 4 * 2 = 8.

Let's assume the original length of the rectangle is L and the original width is W.

Given that one side is taken 5% in excess, the actual length would be 1.05L.
And the other side is taken 4% in deficit, the actual width would be 0.96W.

The original area of the rectangle is A = L * W.
The actual area of the rectangle is A' = (1.05L) * (0.96W) = 1.008LW.

The error in the area is A' - A = 1.008LW - LW = 0.008LW.

According to the given information, the length of the rectangle is three times its breadth, so the length would be 3b.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the given values, we have:
120 = 2(3b + b)

Simplifying the equation:
120 = 2(4b)
120 = 8b
b = 15

Therefore, the breadth of the rectangle is 15 m, and the length is 3 * 15 = 45 m.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: A = length * breadth

Now, we need to check if the circular region is completely within the rectangular field. If the radius is less than or equal to the shortest side of the rectangle (25 m in this case), then the entire circular region is within the field.

Since 22 m is less than 25 m, the horse can graze over the entire circular region.
