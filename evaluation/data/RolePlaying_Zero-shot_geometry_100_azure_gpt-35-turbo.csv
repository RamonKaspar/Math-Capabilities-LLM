When the squares are cut off from each corner, the length and width of the rectangular sheet will be reduced by twice the length of the square (3 m).

Length of the box = Length of the rectangular sheet - 2 * Length of the square

The given information states that the remaining percentage after accounting for salaries, research and development, utilities, equipment, and supplies is used for transportation. To find this percentage, we can subtract the sum of the mentioned percentages from 100%:

100% - (55% + 9% + 5% + 4% + 2%) = 100% - 75% = 25%

Therefore, transportation represents 25% of the budget.

To convert this percentage to degrees, we can use the fact that a circle has 360 degrees. We can set up a proportion:

Given that the volume of the large sphere container is 11248 liters, we can set up the equation as follows:
