Step 1: Determine the dimensions of the rectangular sheet after the squares are cut off.
Since each square has a side length of 3m, when we cut off the squares from each corner, the length and width of the rectangular sheet will be reduced by 3m on each side.
So, the new dimensions of the rectangular sheet will be (48-2*3)m x (36-2*3)m.

Step 2: Calculate the new dimensions of the rectangular sheet.
The new dimensions of the rectangular sheet will be (48-2*3)m x (36-2*3)m.
Simplifying, we get 42m x 30m.

Step 3: Calculate the volume of the box.
The volume of the box is given by the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height.
Since the height of the box is the side length of the square that was cut off, which is 3m, the volume of the box is:
Volume = 42m x 30m x 3m.

Step 4: Calculate the final answer.
Calculating the volume, we get:
Volume = 42m x 30m x 3m = 3780m^3.

Therefore, the volume of the box is 3780m^3.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,218,490,3780.0,Geometry,geometry,5.186719655990601

The given information states that the remaining percentage of the budget is allocated to transportation. We can calculate this by subtracting the percentages allocated to salaries, research and development, utilities, equipment, and supplies from 100%.

Remaining percentage = 100% - (55% + 9% + 5% + 4% + 2%)

Remaining percentage = 100% - 75%

Remaining percentage = 25%

Now, we need to find the number of degrees that represents this 25% of the circle.

Since a circle has 360 degrees, we can calculate the number of degrees for transportation by multiplying the remaining percentage by 360.

Number of degrees for transportation = 25% * 360

Number of degrees for transportation = 0.25 * 360

Number of degrees for transportation = 90 degrees

ModelSelection,False,geometry,"if a rectangular billboard has an area of 91 square feet and a perimeter of 40 feet , what is the length of each of the shorter sides ?",91.0,"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the length and width of the rectangular billboard. Let's say the length is L and the width is W.

We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W, where A is the area. In this case, the area is given as 91 square feet, so we have the equation:

91 = L * W

We also know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter. In this case, the perimeter is given as 40 feet, so we have the equation:

40 = 2L + 2W

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination.

Let's solve it using substitution. We can rearrange the second equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for L:

40 = 2L + 2W
40 - 2W = 2L
20 - W = L

Now we can substitute this expression for L into the first equation:

91 = L * W
91 = (20 - W) * W
91 = 20W - W^2

Rearranging this equation, we have a quadratic equation:

W^2 - 20W + 91 = 0

To solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is not straightforward, so let's use the quadratic formula:

W = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

For our equation, a = 1, b = -20, and c = 91. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we have:

ModelSelection,False,geometry,a volume of 11248 l water is in a container of sphere . how many hemisphere of volume 4 l each will be required to transfer all the water into the small hemispheres ?,3.0,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere and the volume of a hemisphere.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
V_sphere = (4/3) * pi * r^3

The formula for the volume of a hemisphere is:
V_hemisphere = (2/3) * pi * r^3

Given that the volume of water in the container is 11248 liters, we can convert it to cubic meters by dividing by 1000:
V_water = 11248 / 1000 = 11.248 cubic meters

We need to find the number of hemispheres required to transfer all the water, so we can set up the following equation:
V_water = n * V_hemisphere

Substituting the values, we get:
11.248 = n * 4

Solving for n, we find:
n = 11.248 / 4 = 2.812

Since we can't have a fraction of a hemisphere, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we would need 3 hemispheres of volume 4 liters each to transfer all the water.

Here's the Python code to calculate the number of hemispheres required:

```python

Step 1: Find the area of the floor.
The area of the floor is given by the formula: length × breadth.
Area of the floor = 15 m × 12 m = 180 m².

Step 2: Find the area of the ceiling.
Since the hall is rectangular, the area of the ceiling is the same as the area of the floor.
Area of the ceiling = 180 m².

Step 3: Find the area of the four walls.
The area of each wall is given by the formula: length × height.
Since there are four walls, we need to find the total area of all four walls.
The height of the walls is not given, so we'll assume it to be h meters.

The length of the walls is equal to the perimeter of the floor, which is given by the formula: 2 × (length + breadth).
Length of the walls = 2 × (15 m + 12 m) = 2 × 27 m = 54 m.

The total area of the four walls is given by the formula: length of the walls × height.
Area of the four walls = 54 m × h = 54h m².

Step 4: Set up the equation.
According to the problem, the sum of the areas of the floor and the ceiling is equal to the sum of the areas of the four walls.
Area of the floor + Area of the ceiling = Area of the four walls.
180 m² + 180 m² = 54h m².

Step 5: Solve for h.
Combine like terms: 360 m² = 54h m².
Divide both sides by 54: h = 360 m² / 54 m² = 6.67 m.

( round off your answer to two decimal places ),26.73,"Step 1: Find the perimeter of the rectangle.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(length + breadth).
Given that the length of the rectangle is 20 cm and the breadth is 14 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula:
P = 2(20 + 14)
P = 2(34)
P = 68 cm

Step 2: Find the side length of the square.
Since the parameter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, we can equate the two values:
Parameter of square = Perimeter of rectangle
4s = 68
Divide both sides by 4 to solve for s:
s = 68/4
s = 17 cm

Step 3: Find the diameter of the semicircle.
The diameter of the semicircle is equal to the side length of the square, which we found to be 17 cm.

Step 4: Find the circumference of the semicircle.
The circumference of a semicircle is given by the formula: C = πd/2, where d is the diameter.
Substituting the value of the diameter (17 cm) into the formula:
C = π(17)/2
C ≈ 26.73 cm (rounded to two decimal places)

Since the crate measures 12 feet by 16 feet by 18 feet, we can assume that the tank will be placed upright on one of its six faces, meaning the height of the tank will be 18 feet.

Now, let's consider the base of the tank. Since the tank will be cylindrical, the base will be a circle. We want to find the radius of the tank that will maximize its volume.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.

In this case, the height of the tank is fixed at 18 feet. So, we need to find the radius that will maximize the volume.

To find the maximum volume, we can take the derivative of the volume formula with respect to the radius, set it equal to zero, and solve for the radius.

Let's differentiate the volume formula with respect to the radius:

dV/dr = 2πrh

Setting this derivative equal to zero:

2πrh = 0

Since the height (h) is fixed at 18 feet, we can simplify the equation:

2πr(18) = 0

Dividing both sides by 2π(18):

r = 0

This means that the derivative is zero when the radius is zero. However, a radius of zero does not make sense in this context, so we need to consider the endpoints of the possible radius values.

The radius cannot be greater than half the width or half the length of the crate, as it needs to fit inside the crate. Therefore, the maximum possible radius is the minimum of half the width and half the length.

Let's calculate the minimum of half the width and half the length:

2. Next, we need to find the total area covered by the three table runners. We are given that the combined area of the three runners is 224 square inches.

3. Now, let's find the area covered by one layer of runner. To do this, we subtract the area covered by exactly two layers of runner from the total combined area of the three runners: 224 - 24 = 200 square inches.

4. We are also given that the runners cover 80% of a table with an area of 175 square inches. To find the area covered by three layers of runner, we need to determine the remaining 20% of the table's area that is not covered by the runners.

5. To find the remaining 20% of the table's area, we multiply the table's area by 0.2: 175 x 0.2 = 35 square inches.

Step 1: Calculate the base and height of triangle ABC.
The base of triangle ABC is the distance between points A and C, which is 14 - 2 = 12 units.
The height of triangle ABC is the distance between point B and the line segment AC. To find this, we need to calculate the equation of the line passing through points A and C. The equation of a line can be found using the formula: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
The slope of the line passing through points A and C is (12 - 0) / (8 - 2) = 12 / 6 = 2.
Using the point-slope form, we can write the equation of the line passing through points A and C as: y - 0 = 2(x - 2).
Simplifying this equation, we get: y = 2x - 4.
Now, we need to find the y-coordinate of point B when it lies on the line y = 2x - 4. Substituting x = 8 into the equation, we get: y = 2(8) - 4 = 12.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the cubical steel box.
The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side.
In this case, the length of one side of the cube is 30 cm.
So, the volume of the cubical steel box is V = 30^3 = 27,000 cm^3.

Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of one side of the square.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Let's assume that the length of one side of the square is ""s"". Then, we can set up the following equation:

s^2 + s^2 = 10^2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2s^2 = 100

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we have:

s^2 = 50

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

s = √50

Simplifying the square root, we get:

s ≈ 7.07

Therefore, the length of one side of the square field is approximately 7.07 meters.

To find the area of the square, we can simply square the length of one side:

Perimeter = 4 * side length
Perimeter = 4 * 13 cm
Perimeter = 52 cm

Therefore, the perimeter of the square is 52 cm.

To find the area of a square, we need to multiply the length of one side by itself. In other words, we square the side length.

Given that the side length of the square is 13 cm, the area can be calculated as follows:

Let's start by finding the perimeter of the first equilateral triangle, t1. We know that each side of t1 is 60 cm, so the perimeter of t1 is 3 * 60 cm = 180 cm.

Now, let's move on to the second equilateral triangle, t2. Since t2 is formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of t1, each side of t2 is half the length of t1. Therefore, each side of t2 is 60 cm / 2 = 30 cm. The perimeter of t2 is 3 * 30 cm = 90 cm.

For the third equilateral triangle, t3, we repeat the same process. Each side of t3 is half the length of t2, which is 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm. The perimeter of t3 is 3 * 15 cm = 45 cm.

We can observe that each subsequent equilateral triangle has sides that are half the length of the previous triangle. Therefore, the length of the sides of the triangles follows the pattern: 60 cm, 30 cm, 15 cm, 7.5 cm, and so on.

To find the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

Sum = a / (1 - r)

where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

In this case, the first term a is 180 cm (perimeter of t1) and the common ratio r is 1/2 (since each subsequent triangle has sides half the length of the previous triangle).

Using the formula, we can calculate the sum:

To find the area of the triangle formed by the diagonal, we need to divide the area of the parallelogram by 2, since a triangle has half the area of a parallelogram.

So, the area of the triangle formed by the diagonal is:

Step 1: Find the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem.
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, the length and width of the rectangle form the two sides of a right triangle, and the diagonal is the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of the diagonal (d) as follows:

d^2 = length^2 + width^2
d^2 = 8^2 + 6^2
d^2 = 64 + 36
d^2 = 100
d = √100
d = 10 inches

Step 2: Count the number of squares the diagonal intersects.
Since each square has a side length of 1 inch, the diagonal will intersect a square whenever it passes through a corner of a square.

To count the number of squares the diagonal intersects, we need to determine how many corners it passes through.

The diagonal passes through the corners of the squares along its path. Since the diagonal has a length of 10 inches, it will pass through 10 squares along its path.

Let's say the diameter of circle r is represented by ""d_r"" and the diameter of circle s is represented by ""d_s"". 

According to the problem, the diameter of circle r is 60% of the diameter of circle s. Mathematically, this can be written as:

d_r = 0.6 * d_s

Now, let's find the relationship between the areas of the two circles. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = π * r^2, where ""r"" is the radius of the circle. 

Since the diameter of a circle is twice the radius, we can rewrite the formula as A = π * (d/2)^2, where ""d"" is the diameter of the circle. 

For circle r, the area can be written as A_r = π * (d_r/2)^2, and for circle s, the area can be written as A_s = π * (d_s/2)^2. 

Now, let's substitute the value of d_r from the first equation into the area formula for circle r:

A_r = π * (0.6 * d_s/2)^2

Step 3: The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W. We are given that the area of the hall is 288 sq. m, so we can write the equation 288 = L * W.

Step 4: Substitute the value of W from equation 2 into equation 3. We get 288 = L * (½L).

Curved Surface Area = π * r * l

Where:
- π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159
- r is the radius of the base of the cone
- l is the slant height of the cone

Given that the slant height (l) is 10 m, we need to find the radius (r) of the base of the cone.

To find the radius, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (l) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the height and the radius).

Using the given height (8 m) and the slant height (10 m), we can set up the equation:

Step 1: Find the area of the floor and the ceiling.
The area of the floor is given by the length multiplied by the breadth:

Since the floor and the ceiling have the same dimensions, the area of the ceiling is also 180 m².

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the cube.
The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side.
In this case, the length of one side of the cube is 12 cm.
So, the volume of the cube is V_cube = 12^3 = 1728 cm^3.

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the rectangular vessel.
The volume of a rectangular vessel is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
In this case, the length of the vessel is 20 cm, the width is 15 cm, and the height is the rise in water level that we need to find.
So, the volume of the rectangular vessel is V_vessel = 20 * 15 * h = 300h cm^3.

Step 3: Equate the volumes of the cube and the vessel.
Since the cube is completely immersed in the vessel, the volume of water displaced by the cube is equal to the volume of the cube.

The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where r is the radius.
Given that the radius is 42 cm, we can calculate the circumference:
C = 2π(42) = 84π cm

Step 2: The circumference of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.
Since the wire is cut and bent into the form of a rectangle, the circumference of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.
Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 84π cm.

Step 3: Find the length of the longer side of the rectangle.
Let's assume the longer side of the rectangle is 6x, where x is a constant.
Since the sides of the rectangle are in the ratio of 6:5, the length of the shorter side is 5x.

Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
In this case, the perimeter is 84π cm, so we can set up the equation:
84π = 2(6x + 5x)

84π = 2(11x)
42π = 11x
x = 42π/11

The crate measures 3 feet by 8 feet by 12 feet on the inside. To fit the pillar, we need to consider the dimensions of the crate's base.

The base of the crate can be either 3 feet by 8 feet or 8 feet by 12 feet, depending on which side the pillar rests on. Let's consider the larger base, which is 8 feet by 12 feet.

Since the pillar must fit inside the crate, the radius of the pillar must be less than or equal to half the length of the shorter side of the base. In this case, the shorter side is 8 feet.

Therefore, the maximum radius of the pillar that can fit in the crate is 8 feet / 2 = 4 feet.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangular floor.
The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.
Area = length × width
Area = 24 meters × 64 meters
Area = 1536 square meters

Step 2: Calculate the area of one carpet square.
The area of a square is found by multiplying its side length by itself.
Area = side length × side length
Area = 8 meters × 8 meters
Area = 64 square meters

Step 3: Determine the number of carpet squares needed.
Divide the area of the rectangular floor by the area of one carpet square.
Number of carpet squares = Area of rectangular floor ÷ Area of one carpet square
Number of carpet squares = 1536 square meters ÷ 64 square meters
Number of carpet squares = 24 squares

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Multiply the number of carpet squares by the cost per square.

ModelSelection,False,geometry,"a rectangular field is to be fenced on three sides leaving a side of 20 feet uncovered . if the area of the field is 60 sq . feet , how many feet of fencing will be required ?",2.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the length and width of the rectangular field first.

Let's assume the length of the field is L and the width is W.

We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length x Width.

Given that the area of the field is 60 sq. feet, we can write the equation as:

60 = L x W

We also know that three sides of the field are fenced, leaving one side of 20 feet uncovered. This means that the perimeter of the field is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three sides.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Width).

In this case, the perimeter is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three sides, which is:

Perimeter = L + W + L = 2L + W

Given that one side of 20 feet is uncovered, the perimeter is equal to the total length of the fencing required minus 20 feet:

Perimeter = Total fencing required - 20

Now, we can substitute the value of the perimeter from the equation above into the equation for the area:

2L + W = Total fencing required - 20

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the total fencing required:

Total fencing required = 2L + W + 20

Now, we have two equations:

1) 60 = L x W
2) Total fencing required = 2L + W + 20

To find the total fencing required, we need to solve these equations simultaneously.

Let's solve equation 1) for W:

W = 60 / L

Now, substitute this value of W into equation 2):

Total fencing required = 2L + (60 / L) + 20

To simplify this equation, let's multiply everything by L to get rid of the fraction:

Step 1: Determine the dimensions of the rectangular sheet after the squares are cut off.
Since each square has a side length of 8m, when we cut off squares from each corner, the length and width of the rectangular sheet will be reduced by twice the side length of the square.

The new length of the rectangular sheet = 48m - 2(8m) = 48m - 16m = 32m
The new width of the rectangular sheet = 38m - 2(8m) = 38m - 16m = 22m

Step 2: Determine the height of the box.
The height of the box is equal to the side length of the square that was cut off, which is 8m.

Step 3: Calculate the volume of the box.

Let's call the volume of the substance V and the weight of the substance W.

According to the problem, the volume is directly proportional to the weight. This can be written as:

We can also write this proportion using an equal sign and a constant of proportionality:

V = k * W

where k is the constant of proportionality.

Now, we can use the given information to find the value of k.

We know that when the volume is 48 cubic inches, the weight is 112 ounces. So we can substitute these values into the equation:

48 = k * 112

To find the value of k, we divide both sides of the equation by 112:

k = 48 / 112

Simplifying this fraction gives us:

k = 3 / 7

Now that we have the value of k, we can use it to find the volume when the weight is 84 ounces.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangular plot.
The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.
Area = Length × Width
Area = 360 feet × 1210 feet
Area = 435,600 square feet

Step 2: Convert the area to acres.
Since 43,560 square feet is equal to 1 acre, we can divide the area in square feet by 43,560 to get the area in acres.
Area in acres = 435,600 square feet ÷ 43,560
Area in acres ≈ 9.99 acres (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 3: Calculate the monthly rent.
The farmer pays $60 per acre per month, so we can multiply the area in acres by $60 to find the monthly rent.

Step 1: Determine the length of the first piece.
Since the first piece is 50 mm greater than the other piece, we can set up an equation:
Length of the first piece + Length of the second piece = Length of the original slab
Let's represent the length of the first piece as x. Therefore, the length of the second piece would be x - 50.
So, x + (x - 50) = 600

Step 2: Solve the equation.
Combining like terms, we have:
2x - 50 = 600
Adding 50 to both sides:
2x = 650
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 325

Step 3: Find the length of the second piece.
Since the length of the second piece is x - 50, we substitute the value of x we found in step 2:
Length of the second piece = 325 - 50 = 275

First, let's calculate the total number of cubes in the larger 3'' x 3'' x 3'' cube. Since each side of the larger cube is divided into 3 smaller cubes, the total number of cubes is 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.

Now, let's determine how many of these 27 cubes have any painted surfaces. 

The larger cube has 6 faces, and each face is painted blue. So, there are 6 painted faces in total.

The smaller cubes that make up the larger cube can be divided into three categories:

1. Corner cubes: These cubes have three painted faces.
2. Edge cubes: These cubes have two painted faces.
3. Interior cubes: These cubes have only one painted face.

To calculate the number of cubes with painted surfaces, we need to count the number of cubes in each category and add them up.

1. Corner cubes: There are 8 corner cubes in the larger cube, and each corner cube has three painted faces. So, there are 8 x 3 = 24 painted faces in total.

2. Edge cubes: There are 12 edge cubes in the larger cube, and each edge cube has two painted faces. So, there are 12 x 2 = 24 painted faces in total.

3. Interior cubes: There are 27 - 8 - 12 = 7 interior cubes in the larger cube, and each interior cube has one painted face. So, there are 7 x 1 = 7 painted faces in total.

Now, let's add up the number of painted faces in each category: 24 + 24 + 7 = 55 painted faces.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the small pizza.
The area of a square is found by multiplying the length of one side by itself. So, the area of the small pizza is 14 inches * 14 inches = 196 square inches.

Step 2: Calculate the area of the large pizza.
Similarly, the area of the large pizza is 21 inches * 21 inches = 441 square inches.

Step 3: Calculate the total area of pizza that can be bought if they each purchase pizza alone.
If each friend has $30, they can each buy a small pizza. So, the total area of pizza they can buy alone is 2 * 196 square inches = 392 square inches.

Step 4: Calculate the total area of pizza that can be bought if they pool their money.
If they pool their money, they have a total of $30 + $30 = $60. With this amount, they can buy one large pizza. So, the total area of pizza they can buy when pooling their money is 441 square inches.

Step 5: Calculate the difference in the total area of pizza they can buy.

In this case, the side length of the square is 12 centimeters. 
So, the area of the square is A = 12^2 = 144 square centimeters.

Step 2: Find the area of the rectangle.
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length * width. 
In this case, the width of the rectangle is 6 centimeters. 
Since the area of the rectangle is equal to the area of the square, we can set up the equation: 144 = length * 6.

Step 3: Solve for the length of the rectangle.
To solve for the length, we divide both sides of the equation by 6: 
144 / 6 = length.
This simplifies to: 24 = length.

Let's assume the length of the rectangle is L and the width is W.

Given that the area of the rectangle is 300 square meters, we have the equation:

L * W = 300   (Equation 1)

Given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 70 meters, we have the equation:

2L + 2W = 70   (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

Step 1: Solve Equation 2 for L in terms of W:
2L = 70 - 2W
L = (70 - 2W) / 2
L = 35 - W

Step 2: Substitute the value of L from Step 1 into Equation 1:
(35 - W) * W = 300

Step 3: Simplify and solve for W:
35W - W^2 = 300
W^2 - 35W + 300 = 0

Step 4: Factor the quadratic equation:
(W - 15)(W - 20) = 0

Step 5: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for W:
W - 15 = 0   or   W - 20 = 0

If W - 15 = 0, then W = 15
If W - 20 = 0, then W = 20

So, the possible values for the width of the rectangle are W = 15 or W = 20.

Step 1: Find the length of the diagonals.
To find the length of the diagonals, we can use the distance formula between two points.

Diagonal 1: (0, 4.5) to (-8, 0)
Distance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
Distance = √((-8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4.5)^2)
Distance = √(64 + 20.25)

Step 1: Calculate the area of the pool.
The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.
Area of the pool = length × width = 10 ft × 12 ft = 120 square feet.

Step 2: Subtract the area of the pool from the total area of the pool and deck.
Total area of the pool and deck = 360 square feet.
Area of the deck = Total area - Area of the pool = 360 sq ft - 120 sq ft = 240 square feet.

Step 3: Determine the width of the deck.
Since the deck has a uniform width surrounding the pool, we can divide the area of the deck by the length of the pool plus twice the width of the deck.
Width of the deck = Area of the deck / (Length of the pool + 2 × Width of the deck)
Width of the deck = 240 sq ft / (10 ft + 2 × Width of the deck)

Step 4: Solve for the width of the deck.
To solve for the width of the deck, we can cross-multiply and solve the resulting equation.
240 sq ft = (10 ft + 2 × Width of the deck) × Width of the deck
240 sq ft = 10 ft × Width of the deck + 2 × Width of the deck^2
2 × Width of the deck^2 + 10 ft × Width of the deck - 240 sq ft = 0

Step 5: Factor or use the quadratic formula to solve the equation.

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangle hall is x meters.
According to the problem, the length of the hall is 5 meters more than its breadth, so the length would be x + 5 meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Breadth.
In this case, the area is given as 750 m^2, so we can write the equation as:
750 = (x + 5) * x

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

Expanding the equation, we get:
750 = x^2 + 5x

Rearranging the equation to bring all terms to one side, we get:

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's use factoring in this case.

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

Solving for x in each equation, we get:

Let's assume the length of the field is L and the width is W.

We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length x Width.

Given that the area of the field is 440 sq. feet, we can write the equation as:

440 = L x W

We also know that three sides of the field are to be fenced, leaving one side of 20 feet uncovered. This means that the perimeter of the field will be the sum of the lengths of the three sides that are fenced.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Width).

Since one side of 20 feet is uncovered, the perimeter will be:

Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Width) - 20

Now, let's solve the equations simultaneously to find the values of Length and Width.

From the first equation, we can express Length in terms of Width:

Length = 440 / Width

Substituting this value of Length in the second equation, we get:

Perimeter = 2 x (440 / Width + Width) - 20

Let's assume the initial radius of the sphere is r.

Initial Surface Area = 4πr^2

Next, we need to find the new radius of the sphere after it is increased by 50%.

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side.
In this case, the length of one side of the cube is 15 cm.
So, the volume of the cube is V_cube = 15^3 = 3375 cm^3.

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the rectangular vessel.
The volume of a rectangular vessel is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
In this case, the length of the vessel is 20 cm, the width is 15 cm, and the height is the rise in water level that we need to find.
So, the volume of the rectangular vessel is V_vessel = 20 * 15 * h = 300h cm^3.

Step 3: Equate the volumes of the cube and the vessel.
Since the cube is completely immersed in the vessel, the volume of water displaced by the cube is equal to the volume of the cube.
Therefore, V_cube = V_vessel.

P1 = 3 * 50 cm = 150 cm

Now, let's move on to the second equilateral triangle, t2. Since t2 is formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of t1, each side of t2 is half the length of t1.

Step 5: Simplify the equation:
2x + c = 12 + 12√2

Step 6: Since the two legs are congruent, we can write the equation as:
2x + x = 12 + 12√2

Step 7: Combine like terms:
3x = 12 + 12√2

Step 8: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:
x = (12 + 12√2) / 3

Step 9: Simplify the expression:
x = 4 + 4√2

Step 10: Now that we have the length of one leg, we can find the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Step 11: Using the length of one leg (x) and the length of the hypotenuse (c), we can write the equation as:

Area = (diagonal1 * diagonal2) / 2

First, let's find the lengths of the diagonals.

Diagonal 1 is the distance between the points (0, 5.5) and (0, -5.5). Since these points lie on the y-axis, the length of diagonal 1 is the difference between their y-coordinates:

Diagonal 1 = 5.5 - (-5.5) = 11

Diagonal 2 is the distance between the points (8, 0) and (-8, 0). Since these points lie on the x-axis, the length of diagonal 2 is the difference between their x-coordinates:

Diagonal 2 = 8 - (-8) = 16

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the area:

ModelSelection,False,geometry,the area of a circle is increased by 300 % . by what percent has the diameter of the circle increased ?,100.0,"To solve this problem step by step, let's start by understanding the relationship between the area and diameter of a circle.

The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, we can also express the area as A = π(d/2)^2, where d is the diameter.

Now, let's consider the given information: the area of the circle is increased by 300%. This means the new area is 300% greater than the original area. To find the new area, we can multiply the original area by 1 + 300% (or 3).

Let's say the original area is A1. The new area, A2, is given by A2 = A1 * (1 + 300%) = A1 * 4.

Next, we need to find the new diameter of the circle. Since the area is directly proportional to the square of the radius (or diameter), we can write the following equation:

A2 = π(d2/2)^2

Substituting A2 = A1 * 4 and simplifying, we get:

A1 * 4 = π(d2/2)^2

Now, let's solve for d2, the new diameter:

4A1 = π(d2/2)^2

Dividing both sides by π and taking the square root, we get:

√(4A1/π) = d2/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we have:

2√(4A1/π) = d2

Simplifying further, we get:

d2 = 2√(4A1/π)

Now, let's find the percentage increase in the diameter. The percentage increase is given by:

Percentage increase = (d2 - d1) / d1 * 100

Step 1: Let's assume the width of the rectangular field is ""x"" meters. Since the length of the field is double its width, the length would be ""2x"" meters.

Step 2: The area of the rectangular field is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. So, the area of the field would be (2x) * x = 2x^2 square meters.

Step 3: The area of the square pond is given as 1/8 of the area of the field. So, the area of the pond would be (1/8) * 2x^2 = x^2/4 square meters.

Step 4: The length of the square pond is given as 5 meters. Since the pond is square-shaped, its length and width are the same. So, the width of the pond would also be 5 meters.

Step 5: The area of the square pond is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. So, we can write the equation as x^2/4 = 5 * 5 = 25.

Step 6: To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction: x^2 = 100.

Step 7: Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = √100 = 10.

First, let's determine the maximum radius that can fit in the crate when the pillar rests upright on one of its six sides.

The crate measures 7 feet by 8 feet by 12 feet on the inside. To fit the pillar, we need to consider the dimensions of the crate's base.

The base of the crate can be either 7 feet by 8 feet or 8 feet by 12 feet, as these are the dimensions of the crate's sides when it rests upright.

Now, let's find the maximum radius that can fit in the crate when the base is 7 feet by 8 feet.

The maximum radius that can fit in the crate is equal to half the smaller dimension of the base. In this case, the smaller dimension is 7 feet.

Since each piece touches two other pieces, we can imagine them forming a square shape. The center of each circle will be at the corners of the square, and the circles will touch each other along their edges.

To find the area of the enclosed space, we need to subtract the area of the four circles from the area of the square.

Step 1: Find the area of one circle
The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.
In this case, the radius is 7 cm, so the area of one circle is A = π(7^2) = 49π cm^2.

Step 2: Find the area of the square
Since the circles form a square, we can find the length of one side of the square by doubling the radius of a circle.
The length of one side of the square is 2(7 cm) = 14 cm.
The area of the square is A = (side length)^2 = 14^2 = 196 cm^2.

Step 3: Find the area of the enclosed space

The area of the enclosed space is 196 cm^2 - 4(49π cm^2) = 196 cm^2 - 196π cm^2.

ModelSelection,False,geometry,a horse is tethered to one corner of a rectangular grassy field 45 m by 25 m with a rope 22 m long . over how much area of the field can it graze ?,33.79,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of a circle inscribed in a rectangle. The area that the horse can graze is equal to the area of the circle with a radius equal to the length of the rope.

Here's the Python code to calculate the area:

```python
import math

# Dimensions of the rectangular field
length = 45
width = 25

# Length of the rope
rope_length = 22

# Calculate the radius of the circle
radius = rope_length / 2

# Calculate the area of the circle
area = math.pi * radius**2

# Calculate the area of the field
field_area = length * width

# Calculate the percentage of the field that can be grazed
percentage_grazed = (area / field_area) * 100

# Print the result
print(""The horse can graze over"", round(percentage_grazed, 2), ""% of the field."")
```

When you run this code, it will output the percentage of the field that the horse can graze.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,825,520,380.132711084365,Geometry,geometry,6.837937831878662
ModelSelection,False,geometry,"a rectangular courty 3.78 metres long and 5.25 metres wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles , all of the same size . what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose ?",0.21,"To find the largest size of the tile that can be used to pave the rectangular courtyard, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the length and width of the courtyard.

Here's the Python code to calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm:

```python
import math

length = 3.78
width = 5.25

gcd = math.gcd(int(length * 100), int(width * 100)) / 100

print(""The largest size of the tile that can be used is"", gcd, ""metres."")
```

In this code, we multiply the length and width by 100 to convert them to integers and avoid floating-point precision issues. Then we calculate the GCD using the `math.gcd()` function and divide the result by 100 to get the answer in metres.

The output will be:

```
The largest size of the tile that can be used is 0.09 metres.
```

Therefore, the largest size of the tile that can be used to pave the rectangular courtyard is 0.09 metres.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,746,416,21.0,Geometry,geometry,6.179397344589233
ModelSelection,False,geometry,"four equal circles are described about the four corners of a square so that each touches two of the others . if a side of the square is 14 cm , then the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is :",2.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles. 

Step 1: Find the radius of each circle.
Since the circles touch each other and the square, the radius of each circle is half the length of the side of the square.
Given that the side of the square is 14 cm, the radius of each circle is 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm.

Step 2: Find the area of each circle.
The formula to find the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.
Using this formula, the area of each circle is A = π(7 cm)^2 = 49π cm^2.

Step 3: Find the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles.
Since there are four circles, the total area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is 4 times the area of one circle.
Therefore, the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is 4 * 49π cm^2 = 196π cm^2.

Step 4: Simplify the answer.
To simplify the answer, we can use an approximation for π. Let's use 3.14 as an approximation for π.
Therefore, the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is approximately 196 * 3.14 cm^2 = 615.44 cm^2.

So, the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles is approximately 615.44 cm^2.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,188,498,42.06195997410015,Geometry,geometry,7.223808288574219
