ModelSelection,True,arithmetic,0.1*3.0=,0.3,"
Answer:
To multiply decimals, we can ignore the decimal point and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
So, 0.1 multiplied by 3.0 is the same as 1 multiplied by 30.
Multiplying 1 by 30 gives us 30.
However, we need to consider the decimal places.
The original problem had one decimal place in 0.1 and one decimal place in 3.0.
So, the product should have a total of two decimal places.
Therefore, the answer is 0.1 * 3.0 = 0.30.

ModelSelection,True,arithmetic,721-847=,-126.0,"
Answer:
To subtract 847 from 721, start by aligning the numbers vertically:

   721
- 847

Begin by subtracting the ones place: 1 - 7. Since 1 is smaller than 7, we need to borrow from the tens place. 

Borrowing 1 from the tens place, the tens place becomes 1 - 1 = 0, and the ones place becomes 11 - 7 = 4.

Now, subtract the tens place: 2 - 4. Since 2 is smaller than 4, we need to borrow from the hundreds place.

Borrowing 1 from the hundreds place, the hundreds place becomes 11 - 1 = 10, and the tens place becomes 12 - 4 = 8.

Finally, subtract the hundreds place: 7 - 8. Since 7 is smaller than 8, we need to borrow from the thousands place.

Borrowing 1 from the thousands place, the thousands place becomes 12 - 1 = 11, and the hundreds place becomes 17 - 8 = 9.

Since there are no more places to borrow from, we can't subtract the thousands place.

Therefore, the result of 721 - 847 is -126.

To solve this expression step by step, let's break it down:

Step 1: Simplify the numerator of the fraction (2/16*-4).
   - Multiply 2/16 by -4.
   - 2/16 * -4 = -8/16.
   - Simplify the fraction -8/16 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8.
   - -8/16 simplifies to -1/2.

Step 2: Simplify the denominator of the fraction ((-2)/(-8)).
   - Divide -2 by -8.
   - -2 / -8 = 1/4.

Step 3: Divide the numerator (-1/2) by the denominator (1/4).
   - Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.
   - (-1/2) / (1/4) = (-1/2) * (4/1).
   - Multiply the numerators and denominators: -1 * 4 / 2 * 1 = -4/2.
   - Simplify the fraction -4/2 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
   - -4/2 simplifies to -2.

To find the number of minutes between 12:25 AM and 7:35 AM, we need to calculate the difference in hours and minutes.

Step 1: Convert 12:25 AM to minutes.
12 hours x 60 minutes = 720 minutes
Add 25 minutes to get the total minutes: 720 + 25 = 745 minutes

11:23 AM is 23 minutes after 11:00 AM.

Since the difference is negative, we need to adjust it by adding 60 minutes to get a positive value:

To find the number of minutes between 11:16 PM and 10:18 AM, we need to consider both the hours and the minutes.

First, let's convert 11:16 PM to a 24-hour format. Since PM represents the evening, we add 12 hours to the given time. Therefore, 11:16 PM becomes 23:16.

Next, let's convert 10:18 AM to a 24-hour format. Since AM represents the morning, we keep the time as it is.

Now, we can calculate the difference between the two times. Subtracting 10:18 AM from 23:16, we get 12 hours and 58 minutes.

However, we need to consider that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Since we have 58 minutes, we can subtract 60 minutes from the total and add 1 hour. This gives us a final result of 11 hours and 58 minutes.

To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1155 and 616, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.

Step 1: Divide 1155 by 616.
1155 ÷ 616 = 1 remainder 539

Step 2: Divide 616 by 539.
616 ÷ 539 = 1 remainder 77

Step 3: Divide 539 by 77.
539 ÷ 77 = 7 remainder 0

Since we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the divisor from the previous step, which is 77.

To find the highest common factor (HCF) of 32 and 55, we can use the method of prime factorization.

Step 1: Prime factorize both numbers.
32 can be written as 2^5.
55 can be written as 5 * 11.

Step 2: Identify the common prime factors.
The only common prime factor between 32 and 55 is 1.

Step 3: Multiply the common prime factors.
Since there are no common prime factors other than 1, the HCF of 32 and 55 is 1.
