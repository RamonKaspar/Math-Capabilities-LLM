Answer:
To multiply decimals, we can ignore the decimal point and treat the numbers as whole numbers.
So, 0.1 can be written as 1 and 3.0 can be written as 3.
Now, multiply 1 by 3: 1 * 3 = 3.
Since there is one decimal place in the original problem, we need to place the decimal point in the answer.
So, the answer is 3.0.

CoT,True,arithmetic,721-847=,8.0,"
Answer:
To subtract 847 from 721, start by aligning the numbers vertically:

   721
- 847

Begin by subtracting the ones place: 1 - 7. Since 1 is smaller than 7, we need to borrow from the tens place. 

Borrowing 1 from the tens place, the tens place becomes 1 - 1 = 0, and the ones place becomes 11 - 7 = 4.

Now, subtract the tens place: 2 - 4. Since 2 is smaller than 4, we need to borrow from the hundreds place.

Borrowing 1 from the hundreds place, the hundreds place becomes 11 - 1 = 10, and the tens place becomes 12 - 4 = 8.

Finally, subtract the hundreds place: 7 - 8. Since 7 is smaller than 8, we need to borrow from the thousands place.
