Step 1: Determine the dimensions of the box
Since a square is cut off from each corner, the length and width of the box will be reduced by twice the length of the square. 

Length of the box = 48m - 2(3m) = 48m - 6m = 42m
Width of the box = 36m - 2(3m) = 36m - 6m = 30m

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the box
The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height.

In this case, the height of the box is the length of the square that was cut off, which is 3m.

The given information states that the remaining percentage of the budget is allocated to transportation. We can calculate this by subtracting the percentages allocated to salaries, research and development, utilities, equipment, and supplies from 100%.

Remaining percentage = 100% - (55% + 9% + 5% + 4% + 2%)

Remaining percentage = 100% - 75%

Remaining percentage = 25%

Now, we need to find the number of degrees that represents this 25% of the circle.

Since a circle has 360 degrees, we can calculate the number of degrees for transportation by multiplying the remaining percentage by 360.

Given that the volume of the large sphere is 11248 l, we can set up the equation as follows:
11248 = (4/3)πr^3

Step 2: Solve for the radius of the large sphere.
To find the radius, we rearrange the equation:
r^3 = (3/4)(11248/π)

Now, let's move on to the second equilateral triangle, t2. Since t2 is formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of t1, each side of t2 is half the length of t1.

Therefore, the length of each side of t2 is 50 cm / 2 = 25 cm.
