Let c be the cost of each toy [[var c]]. We're given that each toy costs 5 dollars, so [[eq c = 5]].
Let d be the number of toys Paul could buy [[var d]].
Let e be the total cost of the toys Paul could buy [[var e]]. We have [[eq e = c * d]].
Let f be the total amount of money Paul has [[var f]]. We have [[eq f = a + b]].
We know that the total cost of the toys Paul could buy is equal to the total amount of money he has, so [[eq e = f]].
Substituting the values, we have [[eq 5d = 4 + 11]].
Simplifying, we have [[eq 5d = 15]].
Dividing both sides by 5, we have [[eq d = 15/5]].
