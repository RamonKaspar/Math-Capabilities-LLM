PaL,False,wordProblems,Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces. How many beads did each necklace need?,,"To find out how many beads each necklace needs, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces.

Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
total_beads = 2
total_necklaces = 32

beads_per_necklace = total_beads / total_necklaces

print(""Each necklace needs"", beads_per_necklace, ""beads."")
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Each necklace needs 0.0625 beads.
```

Since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we can round the result to the nearest whole number. Here's an updated version of the code that rounds the result:

```python
total_beads = 2
total_necklaces = 32

beads_per_necklace = round(total_beads / total_necklaces)

print(""Each necklace needs"", beads_per_necklace, ""beads",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,85,200,16.0,Word Problems,challenge,3.2705953121185303
PaL,False,wordProblems," The school cafeteria had 17 apples. If they used 2 to make lunch for the students and then bought 23 more, how many apples would they have? ",,"Sure! Here's the Python code to solve the math problem:

```python
apples = 17
used_apples = 2
bought_apples = 23

total_apples = apples - used_apples + bought_apples

print(""The school cafeteria would have"", total_apples, ""apples."")
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
The school cafeteria would have 38 apples.
```

So, the school cafeteria would have 38 apples after using 2 to make lunch for the students and then buying 23 more.",gpt-35-turbo,azure,0,86,119,38.0,Word Problems,multi_step,1.8087670803070068
