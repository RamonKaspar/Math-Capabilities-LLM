We know that Randy used 52 blocks to build a tower and there were 38 blocks left. 

So, to find out how many blocks Randy had at the start, we need to add the number of blocks used to build the tower and the number of blocks left. 

Let's set up the equation: 

Number of blocks at the start + Number of blocks used = Number of blocks at the start + Number of blocks left 

We can rewrite this equation as: 

Number of blocks at the start + 52 = Number of blocks at the start + 38 

Now, we can simplify the equation by subtracting the number of blocks at the start from both sides: 

52 = 38 

Next, we can subtract 38 from both sides to isolate the number of blocks at the start: 

52 - 38 = Number of blocks at the start

First, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Since each large plank needs 17 nails, and John is using 13 large planks, we can multiply 17 by 13 to find the total number of nails needed for the large planks:

17 nails/plank * 13 planks = 221 nails

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the smaller planks. We know that 8 nails are needed for each smaller plank, but we don't know how many smaller planks John is using. Let's assume he is using ""x"" smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails needed for the smaller planks can be calculated as:

Now, we can add the number of nails needed for the large planks and the smaller planks together to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall:
